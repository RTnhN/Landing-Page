# Landing-Page

You can view a live version of this project at [https://rtnhn.github.io/Landing-Page/](https://rtnhn.github.io/Landing-Page/).

This is my submission for the landing page assignment. I made some small improvements on the requirements to help with different screen sizes and basic mobile requirements. I also made tweaks to the color scheme to just mix it up a bit. I also like the earthier color pallette a bit more.  There are still some things that I want to do with the mobile, but for now it is okay.

Some of the techniques that were applied for this project: 

- Layouts of complex pages
- Flex boxes - including wrapping and non-wrapping
- Reactive width based on view width
- Importing of google fonts
- Using dummy images from [dummyimage.com](https://www.dummyimage.com)
